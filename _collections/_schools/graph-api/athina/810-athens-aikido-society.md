Athens Aikido Society is the oldest Aikido dojo in Greece. It was founded by students of the aikido section of the National Technical University of Athens which was created in 1976-1977 by Costas Politis (the first official Aikido teacher in Greece) and by members of the Kareas Aikido dojo which operates continiously since 1981. In 2012 the society has changed its name to &quot;Athenian Budo Society&quot; and its aims are the study and dissemination of traditional Japanese martial arts.
